# Dave Long - Software Developer

## Overview

I'm a software developer specializing in front-end web development.  I've been studying and working with software development for almost two years now.  I've been focusing on the front-end, so I'm most confortabe working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I'm also familiar with python, go, php, and lua.  I've worked on projects using Hugo, Astro, and WordPress.  

## Learning Path

I'm continuing to develop my front-end skills and knowledge through the materials on [leanwebclub.com](https://leanwebclub.com) and front-end coaching with Chris Ferdinandi, and I'm leaning back-end development by working through the courses on [boot.dev](https://boot.dev).

I'm interested in learning more about web development, data science and machine learning, and programming and computer science in general.

## Open to Work

I'm open to work, including part-time, full-time, remote, hybrid, and in-person postions.  I'm currently working as a freelancer and running a business teaching piano lessons.

##  Background and Location

I'm located in the Hudson Valley in NY.  I have a BA in Philosophy from Boston University and a JD from St. John's University Law School.
